# Unity3D – AI Car Racing Game  
Final Year Blackboard Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an **AI-based Car Racing Game** developed using **Unity 3D and C#** as part of my **Final Year B.Sc. Information Technology project**.

The game allows a player to race against **AI-controlled cars** on a track, demonstrating concepts such as **car physics, artificial intelligence, waypoint navigation, lap timing, and user interface design**.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to design a single-player racing game that provides a realistic driving experience while showcasing AI behaviour in a gaming environment. The AI cars follow predefined waypoints, while the player controls a car using keyboard inputs.

## Technologies Used
- Unity 3D  
- C#  
- Visual Studio  
- Windows (64-bit)

## Features
- Player-controlled car with realistic physics  
- AI cars using waypoint-based navigation  
- Lap counter and lap timing system  
- Main menu and in-game HUD  
- Modular and well-structured Unity C# scripts  

## Project Structure
The repository is organised into folders for AI logic, car control, race management, UI handling, and core game systems. The complete final-year project report is included as `Documentation.pdf`.

## How to Use
This repository contains **source code and documentation only**.  
To run the project, the scripts must be imported into a Unity project, and scenes, GameObjects, and assets must be configured within the Unity Editor.
