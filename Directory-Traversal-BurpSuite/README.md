# Directory Traversal Attack using Burp Suite

This project demonstrates a Directory Traversal vulnerability using
Burp Suite and concepts from PortSwigger labs.

## Project Structure
- `src/` – Vulnerable demo application
- `documentation/` – Report, attack steps, prevention, screenshots

## Tools Used
- Burp Suite
- Python (Flask)
- PortSwigger Labs

## Software & Tools Used

- **Burp Suite** – Used to intercept and modify HTTP requests to demonstrate
  the directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Metasploit Framework** – Used in a controlled lab environment to explore
  vulnerable services and understand exploitation workflow.
- **Nmap** – Used for network scanning and service discovery.
- **Python (Flask)** – Used to build an intentionally vulnerable web application
  for demonstration purposes.
- **Kali Linux** – Used as the attacker machine in the lab environment.
- **Metasploitable2** – Used as the intentionally vulnerable target system.
- **Git & GitHub** – Used for version control and project hosting.


⚠️ All screenshots were captured in a controlled lab environment
(Metasploitable2) for academic and educational purposes only.
